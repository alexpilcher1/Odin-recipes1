    <h2>About the Frito Pie</h2>
    <p>This creative dish has very few ingredients, yet tastes <strong>amazing</strong>! By mixing chili, corn chips, cheese and green onions
         you can have a filling meal making you want more!</p>
    <p> First introduced to me by a friend, I thought initially it sounded too good to be true, but after taking my first bite I was hooked! That's why i'm here 
        to let you know exactly how to make this, in the most simple way possible.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Can of chili with no beans</li>
        <li>1 Cup of shredded cheese</li>
        <li>1 big bag of corn chips</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of diced green onions</li>
        <li>(optional for added spiciness) 1 chopped jalapeno pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove chili from can using a can opener, and place the contents into a microwave-safe dish or metal pan.</li>
        <li>Place shredded cheese on top of chili, this ensures that the cheese will melt onto the chili.</li>
        <li>Add the green onions (and jalepenos if you decided to add them) on top of the chili and cheese, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat this dish in either a microwave for about 45 seconds, or an oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 5-7 minutes if you decided to use a pan.</li>
        <li>Place corn chips into a large bowl or two smaller bowls depending on if you decide to share with a friend!</li>
        <li>Take the heated chili mixed with the ingredients and place it on top of the corn chips, be careful it will be hot.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool until it is ready to eat, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
