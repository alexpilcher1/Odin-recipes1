    <h2>About the Alfredo Pasta</h2>
    <p> This dish is one of my favorite variations of pasta to make, and is a major staple in my diet. There is a million ways to make
        pasta, but this is one of the best! For an added experience, follow this recipe and eat it alongside some toasted bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>box of dried pasta (I recommend penne)</li>
        <li>jar of premade alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>seasoning (can be as simple as salt and pepper)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First put about 4qt of water on high heat until it starts boiling.</li>
        <li>In a seperate pan, heat the alfredo sauce on low heat and stir every now and then.</li>
        <li>Once water is boiling, place penne pasta into pot for about 12-14 minutes (may be shorter or longer depending on type) and stir 
            occasionally.</li>
