    <h2>About the Egg Souffle</h2>
    <p>The egg souffle is a very simple dish, with many possible ingredients depending on what sort of flavor you like.
        I personally like a basic combination of ingredients in order to make this quick, and still provide a lot of flavor!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1/2 lb of ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by panfrying the ground beef until browned, then drain liquid and add seasoning as desired.</li>
        <li>Crack the raw eggs into a metal pan, and add the cooked ground beef.</li>
        <li>Combine the cheese and mixed vegetables into the pan as well, and stir until it is mostly consistent (some of it may sink, that is okay).</li>
        <li>Add the cup of milk and stir even more, until there is a nice spread of the meat and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Place pan into oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Take the pan out of the oven, the top should be brown when finished</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes, then slice into however many pieces you would like.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this delicious and easy to make meal! The leftovers taste just as good microwaved the next day.</li>
    </ol>
